# Easy_Protected_Routes

I created this for an easy way to create protected routes. It only shows protected link when you are loggedin. So loggedin would be true. 
Also I have wrapped the protected Route in protection so you cannot go to the page by http. Did not add much CSS to the file as this is my first attempt in putting something online here.
